Hi, there!

I am a software engineer with 3+ years of experience, specializing in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) / [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for both frontend and backend development.

I have worked with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) and [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/), among other technologies. My expertise allows me to build scalable and efficient applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.

I am currently working at [Wald AI](https://wald.ai), a context intelligence company, which connects businesses with AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Llama while protecting confidential data and managing regulatory compliance.
